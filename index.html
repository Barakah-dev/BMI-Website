        <h1>What your BMI result means.</h1>
        <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight'. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues like 
          type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension and obesity later on. Aim for nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits 
          and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for fives days a week.</p>

        <h1>Limitations of BMI</h1>
        <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person and has limitations. Due to a wide 
          variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along measurements rather than 
          being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>

            <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 
              A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health 
              problems.</p>

          <div class="response hidden">
            <p>BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. 
              To determine if BMI is a health risk, a healthcare provider performs further assessments. Such 
              assessments include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, 
              and family history1</p>

          <div class="response hidden">
            <p>BMI is calculated using only the variables of weight and height. Your BMI is equal to your weight 
              in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. You can also calculate your BMI using imperial 
              units, in which case your BMI is equal to your weight in pounds divided by your height in inches 
              squared, multiplied by 703.</p>

              these methods are not always readily available, and they are either expensive or need to be conducted by 
              highly trained personnel. </p>
